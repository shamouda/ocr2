 * @brief Satisfy the first pre-slot of an event

 * trigger rule:
 *     - ONCE, IDEM and STICKY events will satisfy their
 *       post-slot upon satisfaction of their pre-slot
 *     - LATCH events have a more complex rule; see #ocrEventTypes_t.
 *
 * During satisfaction, the programmer may associate a
 * data block to the pre-slot of the event. Depending on the event
 * type, that data block will be passed along to its post-slot:
 *     - ONCE, IDEM and STICKY events will pass along the data block
 *       to their post-slot
 *     - LATCH events ignore any data block passed
 *

 * @param[in] dataGuid   GUID of the data block to pass along or NULL_GUID
 *
 * @return a status code

 *                an argument and one is given or if the event takes an argument and none
 *                is given
 *
 * An event satisfaction without the optional data block can be viewed as a pure
 * control dependence whereas one with a data block is a control+data dependence
 *
 * @note On satisfaction, a ONCE event will pass the GUID of the
 * optionaly attached data block to all OCR objects waiting on it at that time
 * and the event will destroy itself. IDEM and STICKY events will pass the GUID
 * of the optionaly attached data block to all OCR objects waiting on it at that
