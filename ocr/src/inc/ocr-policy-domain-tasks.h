 * @brief Base type for runtime micro-action
 *
 * An action is what the runtime does once an event becomes

 * be something as simple as satisfying another event or as complex as running
 * a continuation
 *

 *  - TBD
 *
 * An action can be of different type but can also be a specially encoded value
 * which encodes a common action (to avoid the cost of memory allocation). This
 * differentiation happens on the bottom 3 bits: for a regular action (a pointer),
 * those three bits are 0. Other special values currently supported:
 * 001:  Calls the processEvent call passing the event to it.
 *       This allows the very quick encoding of a mechanism to do a callback or
 *       a deferred call (setup an event, enqueue this simple action and let the micro
 *       task scheduler deal with it at some later point) to processEvent
 *       pdEvent_t as an argument and 0 as the PC argument
 * 010:  Send a message out of the policy domain
 * 111: Extended action, the next 5 bits encode the action type:
 *      - 00001: Satisfy another event:
 *                  - Slot ID is bits 32-63
 *                  - Bit 8 will be 1 if the pdEvent_t needs to be copied as opposed
 *                    to just moved
 *      - 00002: Notify a parent merge event that this event is ready
 * An event is essentially ready or non-ready and optionally contains a payload.
 * If an event is not ready and the user needs to ensure that it is ready, a slot
