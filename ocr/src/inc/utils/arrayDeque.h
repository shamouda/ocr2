/**
 * @brief Implements a variable-sized array-based deque
 * that is not thread safe
 *
 * This deque is meant to grow dynamically in size but also
 * to have constant time insertion and deletion at head and
 * tail; in other words, there is never any copy needed when
 * inserting elements.
 *
 * The deque also tries to optimize the number of frees/creates
 * it does by basically only deleting chunks if there is at least
 * one spare chunk on either end of the deque. The idea here is
 * to avoid cases where, if the chunk size is 4, a deque
 * that oscilates between 4 and 5 elements for example, would
 * have to destroy the new chunk and recreate it. This
 * gives some "buffer" and only deletes if it
